# bat-install-quilt
Extremely simple script for installing the QuiltMC Loader for the (as of writing this) latest Minecraft when the `.exe` version doesn't work

Just put it in the same folder as the installer and rename the installer to `quilt-installer.jar`, then run the `.bat` file to install. It uses the built-in Java of Minecraft launcher, and therefore requires the Microsoft Store version of the launcher to work
