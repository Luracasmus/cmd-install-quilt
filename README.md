# cmd-install-quilt
Extremely simple script for installing the QuiltMC Loader for the (as of writing this) latest Minecraft when the `.exe` version doesn't work and you don't have your own version of Java installed

Just put it in the same folder as the [Quilt Universal installer](https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/) and rename the installer to `quilt-installer.jar`, then run the `.bat` file to install. It uses the built-in Java of Minecraft launcher, and therefore requires the Microsoft Store version of the launcher to work
